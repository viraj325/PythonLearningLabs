# TextSummarizar
This is a web application developed with Flask in Python. Once the application is running on a local server, it can summarize a default testing text file or a custom imput by tokenizing each sentence and ranking them based on importance.

## Current Status
This app is no longer being maintained and most probably won't be functional.
